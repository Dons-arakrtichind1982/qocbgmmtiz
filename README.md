Okay, so I just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Snow White, and I have to say, my brain is kind of zinging in all directions right now. The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing—the usual let's turn everyone into popsicles approach—and I was half expecting penguins to march past the screen. Anyway, Snow White. So she's got this creepy stepmom who's obsessed with mirrors? Sure, why not. Totally a recipe for sanity. It's like they took the essence of every passive-aggressive family dinner and bottled it into a fairy tale.

Snow White herself, I mean, she's a cliché wrapped in an archetype wearing a dress that looks like it's made from bedsheets—but I can't deny, there's something kind of charming about her whole let's be friends with woodland creatures approach. Seriously, where can I sign up? I’d love to chat with a squirrel about its acorn stash instead of small talk at parties. By the way, the dwarfs? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 them tromp around like a mismatched rugby team was weirdly satisfying, even if half of them seemed like they'd just wandered off the set of a sitcom. Could they BE any more stereotyped? Also wondering if they have their own union. Anyway, I should probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   at some point because I'm curious how all those dynamic personalities are legally allowed to co-exist under one roof without causing a time-space implosion.

And let's talk about the prince, who seems to have the personality of a slightly confused llama blankly staring into the abyss. Handsome, sure, in that “I should've been the cover 𝘮𝘰𝘥el for a shampoo commercial” way. He kind of just... shows up, kisses the girl, and they trot off to their happily ever after, because THAT'S realistic. It's like, “Hey, you're potentially a necrophiliac, but sure, let's go live in your castle.”

Here's a thought nobody asked for: while 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this, I got kinda lost thinking about how this whole narrative didn’t include a single zebra. You ever notice that fairy tales never give zebras any good lines? They could totally rock the black-and-white morality thing. And now I feel like I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to see if I missed any subliminal zebra imagery. 

Here’s a random thing I found somewhere, and I can’t explain why but it feels weirdly relevant right now:

python
def magic_mirror(fairytale):
    if fairytale == fairest:
        return Snow White
    else:
        return Villain


In the end, I walked out of the theater, and the sunset looked like it’d been dipped in all the leftover colors from Snow White's apple. Cinematic cliché vibes? Yeah, but after a   like that, maybe the universe was just in on the joke. Would I tell you to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Sure, give it a go if you’re into colorful angst and talking animals. But maybe bring a mirror to have a stern chat about your life choices afterwards.
